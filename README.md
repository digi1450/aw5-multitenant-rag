# AW5 — Multi-Tenant RAG-based Conversational AI for SDLC

Senior project repository for a multi-tenant conversational assistant that retrieves evidence from selected Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) project artifacts.

## Current status

- DS1 Project Concept submitted.
- Nature Footprint corpus prepared locally for controlled RAG experiments.
- Dify knowledge bases and an initial retrieval workflow configured.
- DS2 scope, requirements specification, mockup, and evaluation set are the next deliverables.

## Repository structure

```text
docs/
  course-requirements/       Official DS1–DS3 submission requirements
  deliverables/              Submitted and working deliverables
dify/                        Dify workflow export instructions/artifacts

```

## Privacy boundary

The Nature Footprint source documents and derived text are private project material. They are intentionally excluded from Git. Only metadata, corpus notes, and evaluation questions are version-controlled until publication permission is confirmed.

The GitHub repository must remain **Private** while student information and course deliverables are present.

## Dify workflow

The running Dify application is maintained separately from this repository. Export its DSL/YAML after meaningful workflow changes and store the export under `dify/exports/`; never commit API keys or provider credentials.

Custom Dify plugins are maintained in separate Git repositories and are not versioned in this repository.
